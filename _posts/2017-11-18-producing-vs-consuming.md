My brother once remarked that people who blog tend to be working on cool stuff and the causality seems to run both ways: producing cool stuff makes you want to share, while sharing with others encourages you to build more cool stuff.

This blog I hope will force myself to think more clearly, execute my plans efficiently, and connect me to people and ideas that push me forward.
